"""Long-horizon touch bound — the third setup, and the only one that ASSUMES A
MODEL.

WHAT TOUCH IS, AND WHY IT IS HARD
"What price will Bitcoin hit in 2026?" asks about touching the level at ANY
moment before expiry. The option chain has NO direct counterpart for that. The
terminal probability P(S_T > K) falls out of prices model-free; touch does not.

So this measurement differs from the others and is labelled as such: the other
two setups are MODEL-FREE, this one ASSUMES A MODEL.

THE BOUND
For driftless arithmetic Brownian motion the reflection principle gives
touch = 2 * terminal. In the real world none of the three assumptions hold:
drift is not zero, monitoring is not continuous, volatility is not a single
number. So "2" is NOT a constant (D-031).

Under lognormal dynamics in the risk-neutral measure, with a = ln(A/F) and
mu = -sigma^2/2:

    terminal = N((-a + mu*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T)))
    touch    = terminal + exp(-a) * N((-a - mu*T) / (sigma*sqrt(T)))

That gives a BOUND, not a point estimate. The ratio should theoretically sit
between 1 and 2. A ratio BELOW 1 is a no-arbitrage violation: the probability
of touching a level before expiry cannot be smaller than the probability of
CLOSING above it at expiry. Counting those violations is the most valuable
output of this script — because a violation contradicts arithmetic, not a
model.

WHERE sigma COMES FROM
From the chain's own implied volatility, linearly interpolated between the two
strikes nearest the threshold. Solving for sigma by bisection was TRIED and
rejected: N(d2) is not monotone in sigma at upper strikes, and the solver
saturated at 400%.
