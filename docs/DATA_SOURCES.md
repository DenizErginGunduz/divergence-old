# DATA_SOURCES.md — what data we can actually get

The constraint: **free**, no licence will be bought. Updated 2026-09-13.

## Evidence level — read this first

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `LIVE-VERIFIED` | A real call was made and data came back. |
| `DOCUMENTED` | The provider's documentation was read; no call could be made. |
| `UNREACHABLE` | A call was attempted and failed from that environment. Not a judgement about the source. |
| `FORBIDDEN` | The provider explicitly forbids automated collection. |

The distinction matters: failing to reach a source does not mean the source is
closed. Our development sandbox has an allowlisted network, so several endpoints
were unreachable from there; the same endpoints worked without trouble from the
GitHub Actions runner and from Colab.

## 1. BTC / ETH — Deribit · `LIVE-VERIFIED`

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Option chain — **calls and puts** (strike, mark, bid/ask, IV, OI, volume) | no key |
| Index (spot reference) | no key |
| Futures and perpetual | no key |

Endpoints: `https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/public`
- `get_book_summary_by_currency?currency=BTC&kind=option` — the whole chain in one call
- `get_index_price?index_name=btc_usd`

**The put chain is critical (D-032, D-035).** Our first pull contained calls only
and derived the downside probability from deep ITM calls — results were off by up
to a factor of 2.09. The collector now fetches both with `kind=option`.

**Futures data turned out to be unnecessary (D-036).** Put-call parity,
`F = K + C − P`, gives the forward from the chain itself. Across 21 strikes on the
25SEP26 chain the dispersion was 113.75 USD (0.146%) — the chain is internally
consistent. One data dependency dropped.

**Deribit options are inverse:** USD price = BTC premium × index.

**There is no going back:** `get_book_summary` returns the current state only. A
missed day's chain is lost permanently. That is the reason the archive exists
(D-037).

## 2. Polymarket · `LIVE-VERIFIED`

| Endpoint | Status | What it gives |
|---|---|---|
| `gamma-api` `/events?tag_slug=...` | 200 | ladders, rule text, bestBid/bestAsk |
| `data-api` `/trades?market=<conditionId>` | 200 | `proxyWallet, size, price, side, outcome, timestamp, transactionHash` |
| `data-api` `/holders?market=<conditionId>` | 200 | position holders |
| `clob` `/prices-history` | 200 but **empty** | parameters need another try (B-008) |
| `clob` `/book` | 404 | wrong path; not needed |
| `clob` `/trades` | 401 | wants credentials; `data-api` covers it |

**Flow data is the product's second leg (D-038, D-039).** In an options market you
cannot see who is on the other side; on a prediction market you can, because it is
on-chain. That is the structural advantage prediction markets have.

**Measured trade rate (2026-08-30, 106 markets):**

| | fastest | p10 | median | p90 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| time span covered by 100 trades | 0.64 h | 34 h | **248 h** | 3,040 h |

Half the markets have been silent for 24 hours; the busiest does 156 trades an
hour. With `limit=100`, to miss nothing the fetch interval has to be shorter than
the busiest market's 100-trade window (38 minutes). Three runs a day lose nothing
on the median market and can lose something on the busiest — which is why the
collector detects a gap and flags it rather than assuming there is none.

**`offset` pagination support is unverified (D-042).** The script does not assume:
it tries, and writes the outcome into `pagination_worked`. No gap has occurred, so
it has never been triggered.

**Note — geographic block:** Polymarket is not accessible from Turkey. This does
not affect the pipeline; the collector runs on GitHub Actions in the US and
reaches every endpoint. That is the second benefit of the Actions architecture.

## 3. Commodities (gold, silver, oil)

**Price and option chain have to be treated separately.** They are nowhere near
equally hard.

### 3a. Futures / spot PRICE — easy
API Ninjas Commodity, CommodityPriceAPI, OilPriceAPI — all `DOCUMENTED`.
A 15-minute delay is not a problem for us.

### 3b. Option CHAIN — the real bottleneck
CME option data is licensed. None of the free commodity APIs provide a chain.

**The way out: ETF proxies (GLD, SLV, USO).** The cost should not be waved
through:
- **Carry difference** — GLD holds physical gold; the GC future includes carry.
- **Roll decay in USO** — it holds front-month CL and rolls; in contango it drifts
  systematically away from spot oil over long horizons. **USO is NOT a long-dated
  WTI proxy.**
- **Expense ratio** — the fund fee creates a slow drift.

### 3c. The mismatch on the Polymarket side
Our gold ladder settles on the `Gold (GC)` CME future. Comparing it with a GLD
option stacks two conversions on top of each other: GC→GLD and touch→terminal.
Each conversion is a source of error.

## 4. S&P 500

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| SPY option chain | `DOCUMENTED` — free through the equity-option channel |
| CBOE delayed quote pages | **`FORBIDDEN`** |
| ES future | `UNKNOWN` |

**CBOE warning:** automated collection is explicitly forbidden and they state that
they block IPs. It will not go into the pipeline. Looking by hand is fine.

**The good news:** the Polymarket market is already written on SPY (rule text:
Pyth, regular session, split-adjusted). So comparing against SPY options is the
more correct thing to do, and the index-versus-ETF question resolves itself
(D-012).

---

## 5. Equities (Mag7)

| Source | Free tier | Note |
|---|---|---|
| yfinance (Yahoo) | no key | Not an official API. Direct HTTP is blocked from data-centre IPs; the library worked from Colab. |
| Finnhub | 60 calls/min, 20 min delay | The most generous free tier |
| Polygon.io | 5 calls/min | Slow but it works |
| Alpha Vantage | **25 calls/day** | Not usable in practice |

### But the bottleneck is not on the option side (D-021)

I first said equities were the easy side. I had only looked at **data access**, not
at **liquidity**. Measured:

| Asset | Rungs | Median spread | Measurable |
|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | 22 | 0.002 | **20** |
| SPY | 14 | 0.024 | 2 |
| NVDA | 14 | 0.074 | **0** |
| META | 14 | 0.090 | 1 |
| TSLA | 14 | 0.099 | 1 |

Measurable = spread ≤ 0.02 **and** mid < 0.99. The reason for the threshold: the
gaps we measured on BTC were in the 0.006–0.026 range; if the spread is wider than
that, the number produced is the spread, not a market view.

**Equities are not dropped from the product:** they appear in the list, carrying a
reasoned "not measurable" label instead of a number.

## 6. Summary

| Asset | Prediction market | Option chain | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| BTC | very deep | Deribit calls + puts | **working** |
| ETH | deep | Deribit calls + puts | **working** |
| SPY | 14 monthly touch | free channel | ladder liquidity is weak |
| TSLA/NVDA/META | 14 touch each | free channel | **not measurable** — spread |
| Gold/Silver/Oil | present | ETF proxy only | carries proxy error |

## Data rights — what we checked and where we stand

Checked 2026-09-11 by reading the current terms of all three venues. Not legal
advice; this is a record of what the documents say and what we decided.

### What the terms say

**Kalshi** — [Data Terms of Use](https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/kalshi-data-terms-of-service.pdf)

> "You may access content only for your personal use for non-commercial purposes.
> Non-commercial use does not include the use of Kalshi Data without prior written
> consent from Kalshi in connection with: (1) the development of any software program...
> or (2) providing archived or cached data sets containing Kalshi Data to another
> person or entity."

That document governs the **website**. The API has a separate Developer Agreement at
kalshi.com/developer-agreement which we have not been able to read — the domain blocks
automated access. It may be more permissive. **Unread, therefore unresolved.**

**Polymarket** — [Terms of Use](https://polymarket.com/tos), effective 2026-08-11

Prohibits accessing Data "directly or through an API... whether in raw, derived,
aggregated, or anonymized form" **if you are** a Capital Market Client (broker, market
maker, prop trader, index calculator, fund) **or a market data distributor**, and
prohibits redistributing Data **to** those parties. The restriction is aimed at
institutional data resale, not at analytics tools.

Against that, Polymarket runs a [Builders Program](https://builders.polymarket.com/)
which says the protocol is "free and permissionless to use and access — just start
building", explicitly invites projects that "empower users with new analytics", and
lists 50+ third-party tools including data products.

**Deribit** — [Terms of Service](https://support.deribit.com/hc/en-us/articles/25944471089437-Terms-of-Service-DRB-Panama-Inc)

> "The use of market data and/or derived data is for personal use only. You are not
> allowed to aggregate, resell, publish, forward or in any other way process market
> data and/or derived data (except for personal use) without prior written approval."

Broadest wording of the three, and it reaches derived data. It also carves out personal
use explicitly. Deribit's public market-data endpoints need no key and allow
cross-origin requests from a browser, and a commercial analytics ecosystem exists on
top of them (Laevitas, Amberdata, Block Scholes).

### What we concluded

Building a tool on this data is normal and, on two of three venues, actively
encouraged. The thing that made us different from every other tool in the ecosystem
was not the analysis — it was that we published a continuously growing archive of raw
vendor payloads. Other tools display data; none redistribute it in bulk.

That is the specific practice the Kalshi clause names.

### The rolling window is decided but NOT yet implemented

The decision was to keep `raw/` as a rolling window of about 14 days: enough of a
research sample to reproduce the published findings, rather than an indefinite
feed. The same change caps repository growth, measured at 4.03 MB/day, which would
have reached roughly 1.44 GB in a year against GitHub's 1 GB guidance.

**As of 2026-09-13 that pruning does not exist.** `scripts/prune_archive.py` has not
been written and `collect.yml` has no pruning step. The archive is 14 days long
because collection started 14 days ago, not because anything is trimming it.
Tomorrow it will be 15 days and it will keep growing.

An earlier version of this document said the window was in place, citing a
constant in `collector/collect.py`. That constant was removed when it broke the
collector, and this paragraph was not updated with it. Corrected on 2026-09-13.

The ordering, when it is built, matters: pruning runs **after** the private mirror
has been updated successfully in the workflow. If the mirror step is skipped,
pruning must be skipped too, otherwise data is lost silently.

### Still open

- Kalshi's API Developer Agreement is unread. Until it is, the Kalshi position rests on
  website terms that may not be the governing document.
- Pruning is not implemented, so the bulk-archive practice the Kalshi clause names
  is still in effect on the public repository.
- No written permission has been requested from any venue. All three have an
  "unless agreed in writing" carve-out; none has been exercised.
- Deribit's "derived data" wording arguably reaches `findings/latest.json`. We publish
  it because it is a research result rather than a data feed, but that is our reading,
  not their ruling.
- The current position suits a research and portfolio project. A commercial product or
  an investment round changes the analysis and would need proper legal review.
